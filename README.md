# Licence-Control-Prototype

A prototype made for an academic project aiming at restraining execution of a jar and its method, by using a simple system of tokens and temporary access keychains.

To avoid temperance with the jar itself, the prototype also does a server-side checksum verification of the jar, which is previously obfuscated.
